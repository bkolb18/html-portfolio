<h1>The Best Movies According to BK</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Lord of the Rings trilogy</h3>
<p>If you view them as anything but a single movie split in three then you are wrong.</p>

<h3>Star Wars</h3>
<p>The dialog may be cringy and wooden but the story is one of the greatest ever told.</p>

<h3>Kingdom of Heaven (Director's cut)</h3>
<p>The director's cut of Kingdom of Heaven is the greatest movie you never saw.</p>
